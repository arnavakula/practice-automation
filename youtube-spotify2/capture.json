Girls Need Love (Remix)\n\n[Intro: Summer Walker]\nHonestly\n\n[Verse 1: Summer Walker]\nHonestly, I'm tryna stay focused\nYou must think I've got to be joking when I say\nI don't think I can wait\nI just need it now\nBetter swing my way\nI just need some dick\nI just need some love\nTired of fucking with these lame niggas baby\nI just need a thug\nWon't you be my plug, aye\nYou could be the one, aye\nWe could start with a handshake baby\nI'ma need more than a hug\n\n[Chorus: Summer Walker]\nGirls can't never say they want it\nGirls can't never say how\nGirls can't never say they need it\nGirls can't never say now\nGirls can't never say they want it\nGirls can't never say how\nGirls can't never say they need it\nGirls can't never say now, oh now\n\n[Verse 2: Summer Walker & Drake]\nGive it to me like you need it, baby\nWant you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing\nI don't need a reason baby\nI want it 'till you can't fight\nI can give it to you right babe oh\nI wanna be your healing\nI can be real good\nPlease don't get in your feelings\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, and you can't judge (I won't)\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYou don't really call on me like you should\nLink up, I roll through the hood\nProblems but everything's all good my love\nYour nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way\nTrust me it's all okay, trust me it's all\nYou just need some, someone that's calm and patient\nSubmission, domination\nArched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke, that's my best combination\nYou just need some, dick with no complications\nYou just need some, you just need some, late night attention, uncondition\nAll that you're missing my babe\nFucked up, shouldn't even have to justify\nI get it I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time\nBesides, pleasure not meant for one side\nYou should just do what's best for your mind\nHow about I just take my time?\nYou call up my line, I fall up inside you\nGirls need love too I know\n\n[Chorus: Summer Walker]\nGirls need love too (Yeah)\nGirls, girls need love too\nGirls need love (Let me tell you something)\nGirls need love (Girls need loving too)\nGirls need love too\nGirls need love too\n(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving too)\nGirls need love too\nGirls need love too\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb If you like \"Summer Walker & Drake -

Girls Need Love (Remix)\n\n[Intro: Summer Walker]\nHonestly\n\n[Verse 1: Summer Walker]\nHonestly, I'm tryna stay focused\nYou must think I've got to be joking when I say\nI don't think I can wait\nI just need it now\nBetter swing my way\nI just need some dick\nI just need some love\nTired of fucking with these lame niggas baby\nI just need a thug\nWon't you be my plug, aye\nYou could be the one, aye\nWe could start with a handshake baby\nI'ma need more than a hug\n\n[Chorus: Summer Walker]\nGirls can't never say they want it\nGirls can't never say how\nGirls can't never say they need it\nGirls can't never say now\nGirls can't never say they want it\nGirls can't never say how\nGirls can't never say they need it\nGirls can't never say now, oh now\n\n[Verse 2: Summer Walker & Drake]\nGive it to me like you need it, baby\nWant you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing\nI don't need a reason baby\nI want it 'till you can't fight\nI can give it to you right babe oh\nI wanna be your healing\nI can be real good\nPlease don't get in your feelings\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove\nAye, and you can't judge (I won't)\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nYou don't really call on me like you should\nLink up, I roll through the hood\nProblems but everything's all good my love\nYour nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way\nTrust me it's all okay, trust me it's all\nYou just need some, someone that's calm and patient\nSubmission, domination\nArched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke, that's my best combination\nYou just need some, dick with no complications\nYou just need some, you just need some, late night attention, uncondition\nAll that you're missing my babe\nFucked up, shouldn't even have to justify\nI get it I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time\nBesides, pleasure not meant for one side\nYou should just do what's best for your mind\nHow about I just take my time?\nYou call up my line, I fall up inside you\nGirls need love too I know\n\n[Chorus: Summer Walker]\nGirls need love too (Yeah)\nGirls, girls need love too\nGirls need love (Let me tell you something)\nGirls need love (Girls need loving too)\nGirls need love too\nGirls need love too\n(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving too)\nGirls need love too\nGirls need love too\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb If you like \"Summer Walker & Drake -
